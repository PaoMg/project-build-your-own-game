## Project Description
![Adivina quien](https://i.ibb.co/KzScTjQ/image.jpg)

***Guess who? Harry Potter edition*** is a game built for Project 1 of Ironhack's Mexico City DA bootcamp. The program runs with any Python interpreter and it's aimed to be a very minimalistic game that mirrors the original *Guess Who?* *game* but as a one-player character.

"Does your person wear a hat?"
"Does your person wear glasses?"
"Does your person have a big nose?"
