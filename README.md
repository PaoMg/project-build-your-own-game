## Project Description
![Adivina quien](https://i.ibb.co/KzScTjQ/image.jpg)

***Guess who? Harry Potter edition*** is a game built for Project 1 of Ironhack's Mexico City DA bootcamp. The program runs with any Python interpreter and it's aimed to be a very minimalistic game that mirrors the original *Guess Who?* *game* but as a one-player character.

## Workflow
The program starts by asking the player's name and how many rounds he/she'd like to play. A random character is chosen from a .json file and then, the player can start guessing the secret character between these 4 options:

1. Guess the character
2. Guess the gender
3. Guess the house
4. Guess the pratonus

The game ends when the player successfully guesses the secret character's name or the attempts given by the user exhaust.
